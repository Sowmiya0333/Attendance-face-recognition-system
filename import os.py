  prompt="email spam detection front end coding\n\nThe first step in creating a front-end code for email spam detection is to create a web page that allows users to submit their emails. This page should provide a simple form that allows users to enter the email address they want to check for spam. The form should also provide an option for users to select the type of emails they would like to check, such as personal, business, or bulk emails.\n\nThe second step is to create a script that will process the submitted emails. This script should be able to determine if the email is from a known spam source. It should also be able to detect any suspicious content in the email, such as links or attachments, and flag them for further review.\n\nThe third step is to create a back-end code that will analyze the emails. This code should use heuristics to determine if the emails are likely to be spam. It should also be able to use machine learning algorithms to further refine the accuracy of the spam detection. \n\nThe fourth step is to create a user interface that will allow users to view the results of the analysis. This interface should allow users to view the emails that have been flagged as suspicious and to take action on them. The interface should also provide users with the ability to",
